We have four heaters.  Each is rated at 3kW, which means that if they are all switched on we are using 12 units (12kWh) per hour.

I don't know exactly how much our suppliers charge, but for reference Scottish Power charges 52p per unit (1kWh) for electricity.  This means that at today's prices the heaters cost £6 per hour to run.  This does not include the additional power for the water heaters (which might be significant) or the lights (which probably isn't).

If we are charging £10 per hour (or £8 for residents) to use the hall, then clearly in the winter this is going to be a problem, especially considering that when it is cold some pre-heating is always required before the time the hall is actually used.

I can see a number of possibilities to address this:

1)  We raise the booking rate to help cover the heating cost.  We could perhaps only do this in the winter months, or use a lesser rise all year round to even it out.
2)  We offer users the option of having heating, at a surcharge.
3)  We require users to take a meter reading before and after each session, and then bill them for it.  This is somewhat impractical, and we'd probably end up doing it ourselves.
4)  We install our own metering system (for example something like this https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07R11H2Q2) which collects the usage data automatically and allows us to bill accordingly.  Still more work for us, of course.

Additionally, it might be worth installing a thermostat to ensure that the heating is cut off when a suitable temperature is reached.  That might help reduce unnecessary use of the heaters.

In the longer term, we need to seek to reduce our energy usage (insulation, solar/battery combination and so on), but that's not going to hlp us now.

Thoughts?
