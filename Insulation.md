Insulation panels are 1.2x2.4m, giving an area of 2.9sq.m each.

Wall insulation will be required up to a height of 2m.  This gives a total area required (excluding interior end walls, kitchen, toilets and back room) of approximately sq.m.

A 3kW wind turbine (https://sd-windenergy.com/small-wind-turbines/sd3-3kw-wind-turbine/) would have a rotor diameter of approximately 4m and (with grid inverter) is likely to come in at around £7500 (https://solarsuppliesuk.co.uk/product/gh-3kw-horizontal-axis-wind-turbine-system/).  And we're in a dip, surrounded by trees.

Or there's this 5kW one: https://www.tesup.co.uk/product-page/5kw-magnum5-wind-turbine-generator-United-Kingdom which only has a 2.2m diameter, and is £2250, VAT included, with inverter, charge controller and pole.
